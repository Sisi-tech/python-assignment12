**Static vs. Interactive Visualizations:**
Static visualizations are fixed images (like charts in PDFs or reports), while interactive visualizations allow users to explore the dataâ€”zooming, filtering, or hovering for more info. Static visuals are great for summaries, but interactive ones offer deeper insights.

**Advantages of Dashboards for Real-Time Exploration:**
Dashboards allow users to explore up-to-date data instantly without needing to write code. They support quick decision-making and help identify trends or issues as they happen.

**How Plotly and Dash Improve Data Communication:**
Plotly and Dash make data more engaging and understandable by allowing users to interact with visuals. This improves communication with non-technical stakeholders and makes complex insights easier to grasp.
